# UX

## Goals

### Target Audience

- Engaged Couples looking for a wedding venue.

- Wedding planners looking for information about the venue.

- Wedding guests looking to familiarise themselves with the venue before attending a wedding there. 

### User Stories 

The GitHub project board containing Lund Farm user stories can be found [here](https://github.com/users/ElFalch/projects/2/views/1).

- These user stories include some future ideas for the project (labelled as "wont-have" in the project board). 

## Visual Design

### Wireframes

#### Updates to design since creating wireframes: 

- Included a button in the home page introduction section which links to the contact page, to allow for users to get in touch more easily. 

- Changed the photo grid in the gallery page to a carousel to allow for less scrolling, particularly in mobile and tablet viewports. 

- No image was incldued in the contact page to reduce drowding for a clearer presentation of the contact form. 

#### Mobile Wireframe

#### Tablet Wireframe

#### PC Wireframe

### Colours

![Lund Farm colour palette](https://github.com/ElFalch/lund-farm/blob/main/assets/images/colour-palette/lund-farm.png "Lund Farm colour palette")

The colours used reflect those in the home page main image and convey the cosy, inviting atmsophere of Lund Farm whilst providing enough contrast to be eye-catching and accessible. This increases the likelihood that target users access all aspects of the website and will have a pleasant experience when doing so, increasing the use of the website and business services. 

### Fonts 

The fonts used were chosen as they are rustic and relaxed, reflecting the atmosphere of the venue so that user's impressions of the site and busiess are further improved. Delius Swash Caps was used for the headings because the slightly curled letters add a formal touch, signposting each section of the site to increase ease of navigation for users. Lexend Exa was used for the body because of its clear appearance, so that users are more likely to read all of the information provided. 

### Icons 

Icons were taken from the [FontAwsome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/) icon library. 

- A heart icon is used in the navigation bar brand, reflecting Lund Farm's services at a first-impression level, so that target users are encouraged to use the site and business at a deeper level. 

- Icons for Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and YouTube are used in the footer as buttons linking to each of these sites, improving the visibility of these links so that more users follow them. 

- An icon with two speech bubbles is used to highlight the button linking to the contact page on the home page, making this button appear more inviting so that more users are encouraged to click it. 

- An arrow icon is used in the gallery page to direct people to the image carousel after reading instructions about how it works, increasing the number of times the carousel images are viewed. 

- A pencil icon is used in the contact page to highlight the message about filling the form out, increasing the likelihood that the contact form is successfully completed by users. 

### Images

Several images have been used across the site, so their size has been reduced as much as possible whilst maintining the high quality needed to attract users. 

- On the home page, a main image that reflects the colour scheme has been used in the header aswell as images for each of the services cards. This reduces the time needed for users to get a first impression of the services provided by the business, increasing the use of services by target users. 

- The gallery page includes a carousel of attractive images of the venue, further conveying the services provided by the business for users who are interested. 

- On the thanks page, which users are taken to when they submit the contact form, an image has been used to fill empty space and provide some brighter colours and a friendly touch, increasing the impact of the page by and a personal touch, so that users feel certain their message is valued. 

- On the  404 page, which users are taken to when they search for a page which doesn't exist, an image has been used to fill empty space and provide some brighter colours and a friendly touch, so that users are encouraged to visit the page they are directed to (home page).

# Testing 

## Validation

### HTML Validation

The HTML for each page was validated used the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). No errors or warnings were found for any of the pages.

## Automated Testing

### Lighthouse Testing

- Automated testing of the deployed site for performance, accessibility and best practises was conducted using the [Lighthouse tool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse) within Chrome DevTools.  

#### Lighthouse Report Summaries

The total score for performance for each of the pages ranged from 73% to 99%. The total score for accessibility and best practices was 100% for each of the pages.

#### Lighthouse performance report diagnostics

The main negative influence upon Lighthouse performance scores for this site was the large size of some images. However, images were optimised and their size was reduced as much as possible whilst maintaining a high quality. Given that this site relies heavily upon attractive images, and that each page loads fairly quickly with an overall performance score of atleast 70%, it was decided to not reduce the size of the images any further. 

Other significant negative influences upon Lighthouse performance scores were related to the loading of external libraries, so couldn't be resolved without removing the content of the website, something which wasn't attempted due to the already high overall performance scores of each page.

### Wave accessibility testing

Further automated testing for the accessibility of the site was conducted using the [Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/).

#### Redundant link alerts

All page reports contained alerts relating to redundant links to the home page, due to the navbar brand and navbar menu both containing links to the home page. This alert could be resolved by removing the link from the navbar brand, but this link represents an easy and intuitive way for users to find the home page, so this alert was ignored. 

#### Long alternative text alerts

The index and gallery page wave reports also contained some additional alerts relating to long alternative text for the main image in the header of the home page and the marquee and cottage images in the home page services cards and gallery page image carousel. This alternative text was retained, as this is needed to effectively describe the images for those who cannot see them. 

#### Low contrast errors

Errors resulted from a lack of contrast between the "next" and "previous" arrows of the gallery page image carousel and the images themselves, however an increase in contrast was not attempted due to 1. the arrows being best placed on top of the images for a consistent, mobile-first design, 2. The variation in colour of the images meaning that no consistent arrow colour could achieve a good level of colour contrast across all images, and 3. the message in the header of the carousel section explaining the use of the white arrows to navigate the image carousel signposting these arrows and making them easier to find despite the lack of colour contrast.

## Manual Testing 

Manual testing was carried out to ensure all links, forms and 404 error pages worked as intended. Device mode in [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) was used to ensure that the design was responsive and that features were fully functional across all device sizes.
