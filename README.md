### Wireframes

#### Updates to design since creating wireframes:

### Colours

![alt text](https://github.com/ElFalch/lund-farm/blob/main/assets/images/colour-palette/lund-farm-palette.png "Colour palette")

The colours used reflect those in the home page main image and convey the cosy, inviting atmsophere of Lund Farm whilst providing enough contrast to be eye-catching and accessible. 

### Fonts 

The fonts used were chosen as they are rustic and relaxed, reflecting the atmosphere of the venue. Delius Swash Caps was used for the headings because the slightly curled letters add a formal touch and Lexend Exa was used for the body because of its clear appearance. 

### Icons 

Icons were taken from the [FontAwsome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/) icon library. 

- A heart icon is used in the navigation bar brand, after the venue name. 

- Icons for Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and YouTube are used in the footer as buttons linking to each of these sites. 

- An icon with two speech bubbles is used to hilight the button linking to the contact page on the home page. 

- An arrow icon is used in the gallery page to direct people to the image carousel after reading instructions about how it works. 

- A pencil icon is used in the contact page to highlight message about filling the form out. 

### Images

Several images have been used across the site, so their size has been reduced as much as possible whilst maintining the high quality needed to attract users. 

- On the home page, a main image that reflects the colour scheme has been used in the header aswell as images for each of the services cards. 

- The gallery page consists of a carousel of attractive images of the venue. 

- On the thanks page, which users a taken to when they submit the contact form, an image has been used to fill empty space and provide some brighter colours. 


## Page Elements
